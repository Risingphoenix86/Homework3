This assignment was to integrate a random password generator into an established website.
4 types of characters were defined, lower case, uppercase, numerals, and special characters, which were to be able to be selected form at will.
the length of the poassword was to be passed in by the user to determine the number of characters used in the password.
establishing arrays for each type of character were set up, and a function named generatePassword was written to get inputs from the user and to generate the final password.

The coding work was all completed in a single sitting, and as such only a single code commit has been made.
further commits were made to improve file structure to ensure proper deployment.
